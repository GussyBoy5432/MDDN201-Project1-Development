Here is my final website layout, I have successfully communicated my music streaming room "BOOM ROOM". I chose to use a cool blue colour palette with "Modern M" as the font. These colour work well with the font giving authenticity and proffesionalism to the website. My idea was inspired by the Mozilla VR hub where the user can collaborate and create with other people simultaneously. I wanted to bring this idea foward and adress the concern that composers and musicians deal with which is the problem of not being able to listen and create music at the same time over sees. I have pitched a brand/application that will be an essential tool for creating and listening to music across the world and will be a vital resource especially during this COVID 19 period.
