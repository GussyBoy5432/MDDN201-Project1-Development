										<h2 class="major">WHAT IS BOOM ROOM?</h2>
										<p>BOOM ROOM is a music streaming platform which connects users to a listening party allowing them to create music simultaneously. The app will be able to connect users and their peers through voice services via laptop or phone so they can communicate and collaborate over the tunes they love. A long withstanding issue in the music industry is the restraint composers and performers face collaborating and creating music online as the current bandwidth is not sustainable enough to successfully play music in sync. BOOM ROOM will allow these musicians to make collaborative content and pursue their creative endeavours from anywhere in the world. </p>

										<h2 class="major">TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
										<p>BOOM ROOM is an application targeted at everyday music listeners and composers. It is a tool that can be used via laptop on windows or mac. This application will connect all ages. Youth interested in music careers, older more experienced men and women who have worked within the music industry, students working within groups at school or pairs who are interested in experimenting with music as a group. </p>

										<h2 class="major">EXISTING PRODUCTS</h2>
										<p>iTunes – SoundCloud – Apple Music.
All of these applications don’t have a music extension that can connect the user simultaneously – Spotify can do this through an extension <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003966072-Listening-Along-with-Spotify"style="color:#f6ff00;"text-decoration: overline;>(Discord).</a> This extension can only be used through a purchased Spotify premium account and downloading the discord app, this is a restraint on creatives. 

This application should be free to all users who want to express their creativity and connect to others around the world to produce music. Major music brands including iTunes, Soundcloud and Apple Music are all competitive music companies that haven’t included this feature within there applications. This would be a popular tool within this COVID-19 period, as it is a pressing time where people can’t come together physically to collaborate in a studio.

											<h3 class="major">LOGO DEVELOPMENT</h3>
											<p>Here is two different iterations of the BOOM ROOM logo. The design uses a mirror technique to inform the viewer of connecting two people together. This design decision helps the user identify what the brand does and how it helps people colaborate their creative abilities. </p>
											
										</article>
										<article> <a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic10.jpg" alt="" /></a> <h3 class="major">APPLICATION INTERFACE</h3> <p>Here is a template of the link interface where the user will navigate to access the creative space/listening party. The user will have to input a link within the type field and select enter on their keyboard to be directed to the creative space.</p> </article>
										<article>
											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">USERFLOW</h3>
											<p>The user will first be introduced to the opening page which has an overview of the application and how it works. They will then be navigated to a url section that will have the text "input invite link". Once the user enters the friends listening party via the link, they will then be navigated to the creative space room where they can communicate with the person. Have access to tools to edit the music.</p>

											<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">COLOUR SCHEME</h3>
											<p>The cool blue colour palette takes inspiration from ocean waves. When designing the logo I went through different music wave designs to inform the viewer that the brand is music revolved. The colour blue stuck and works well against the hard black and white lines of the text.</p>

											<h3 class="major">MOZILLA HUB (INSPIRATION)</h3>
											<p>This virtual reality hub created by <a href="https://hubs.mozilla.com/"style="color:#f6ff00;"text-decoration: overline;>(Mozilla)</a> is essentially a room where the user can watch videos, interact with 3D objects and just play around. You can download the desktop app or use the website interface. The virtual room is accessible, free, fast, and inclusive which are all positive connotations on the user. </p>
